# Daurama - Recycling Just Got Fun

Daurama is a smart, interactive web application that transforms the confusing chore of recycling into a fun and rewarding experience. Developed as a final project for the Hacktiv8 x IBM bootcamp, Daurama uses AI to identify waste and gamifies the process of learning proper waste management.

## Key Features

  * **AI-Powered Recognition:** Instantly identify waste items by uploading a photo, powered by **IBM Granite AI**.
  * **Interactive Learning:** A dynamic mini-game challenges you to sort waste into the correct bins, making the learning process engaging and effective.
  * **Personalized Profile:** Track your progress and watch your pixel pet companion level up and evolve as you make an impact.
  * **Eco-Impact Report:** See your personal contributions, including CO2, energy, and water saved, in a comprehensive report dashboard.
  * **Community Leaderboard:** Compete with other users on a local leaderboard to become the ultimate Eco-Hero.

## The Tech Stack

This project was built with a modern and robust technology stack:

  * **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, and **Pure JavaScript**
  * **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js
  * **AI Integration:** **Google Gemini API** for visual recognition
  * **Data Management:** User data (history, points, levels) is stored locally using `localStorage`â€”a strategic choice to maintain a lightweight, serverless-style architecture.

## Installation & Setup
